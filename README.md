## **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/frontend-challenge.git
   cd frontend-challenge
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
4. **Run tests:**
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```
5. **Build for production:**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

## **Technical Decisions**

### **Infinite Scroll (Part 1)**
- **Library Used:** `react-window` for list virtualization.
- **Why:** Efficient rendering of large datasets and reduced memory footprint.
- **Data Fetching:** Lazy loading images from a mock API.
- **Performance Features:**
  - Used `useMemo` and `useCallback` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
  - Debounced scroll events to reduce API calls.
  - Implemented a "Load More" button for users who prefer manual fetching.

### **Dedicated Pagination (Part 2)**
- **Library Used:** `react-query` for data fetching and caching.
- **Pagination Strategy:**
  - Implemented both `page` and `limit` query parameters.
  - Optionally used `previousId` and `nextId` for cursor-based pagination.
- **Why:** Efficient cache management and reduced redundant API calls.
- **Performance Features:**
  - Cached previous pages for faster navigation.
  - Implemented skeleton loaders to improve perceived performance.

### **Drag-and-Drop Dashboard (Part 3)**
- **Library Used:** `react-beautiful-dnd` for drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Why:** Smooth drag interactions, accessibility, and state persistence.
- **Charting Library:** `recharts` for interactive analytics visualization.
- **Features:**
  - Four draggable charts.
  - Order persistence to a mock API.
  - Reset button to restore the default order.

## **Trade-offs Between Libraries**

| Feature | Library Used | Alternative | Trade-off |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Virtualization | react-window | react-virtualized | `react-window` is lighter but less feature-rich. |
| Pagination | react-query | swr | `react-query` provides better cache control. |
| Drag-and-Drop | react-beautiful-dnd | dnd-kit | `dnd-kit` is more modern but `react-beautiful-dnd` is widely adopted. |
| Charting | recharts | chart.js | `recharts` offers better component-based integration. |

## **Performance Optimizations**
- **Part 1:** Used virtualization (`react-window`), memoization (`useMemo`), and debounce (`lodash.debounce`).
- **Part 2:** Cached API responses with `react-query` to avoid refetching previously loaded pages.
- **Part 3:** Minimized unnecessary re-renders by optimizing state updates in `react-beautiful-dnd`.

## **Challenges Faced**

### **Infinite Scroll (Part 1)**
- Preventing duplicate API calls when users scrolled too quickly.
- Balancing UI performance with smooth user experience.

### **Dedicated Pagination (Part 2)**
- Deciding between offset-based and cursor-based pagination.
- Ensuring seamless navigation while caching previous pages.

### **Drag-and-Drop Dashboard (Part 3)**
- Handling persistence of reordered charts.
- Ensuring drag-and-drop remains smooth on mobile devices.

## **Error Handling and Modularity**
- Implemented `ErrorBoundary` to catch rendering issues.
- Created modular components for reusability (e.g., `ImageGrid`, `PaginationControls`, `ChartContainer`).
- Used context API for global state management where necessary.
